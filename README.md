biolum
======
/*Bioluminescence attempts to simulate bioluminescent communication exhibited by certain fish and micro-organisms.
  The creatures move with translational velocity as a function of oscillating angular movement. In the proximity of other creatures
  they glow blue to indicate that the area is safe for others of their kind. Groups of creatures behave differently depending upon the
  number of creatures in the group and the anglular trajectory of new additions. If coalesced at nearly parallel angles, a group of two creatures 
  will rotate more slowly about their center points causing their visual representation to change and translate forward until contact with 
  another group. A group of three that converge at  angles offset by about 120 degrees will create a whirlpool effect and rotate about a point
  until more creatures join. As the group gets larger, the inner rotation of each creatures increases resulting in yet another visual change and the larger the group
  becomes the more likely it is to explode and repel the creatures outward. When in the proximity of the hunter, creatures glow red and attempt to evade. The hunters velocity is 
  affected by proximity to the creatures, close to the creatures the hunter will begin to change angular position (and thus affect translational velocity) in a counter clock-wise
  motion and will pulse yellow. If far away it will only rotate ever so slightly in a clock-wise motion and will scan white rings in search of creatures.
